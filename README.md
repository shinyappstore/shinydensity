# shinydist: Explore statistical probability distributions


#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/shinydist](https://shinyappstore.com/a/shinydist)__

Shinydist is a robust application designed for users to explore probability distributions in statistics. Whether you're new to data science or statistics, understanding probability distributions is crucial. These mathematical functions help quantify the likelihood of a random variable assuming a specific value. For instance, when rolling a fair six-sided die, the discrete uniform distribution illustrates that each number has an equal chance of occurring. Shinydist allows users to visualize and comprehend various continuous probability distributions, each tailored for specific scenarios. Examples include the normal distribution, modeling natural phenomena like human heights, the beta distribution for proportions or percentages, and the gamma distribution for the time between events in processes such as customer arrivals at a store. With its user-friendly interface, Shinydist serves as a valuable tool for exploring and grasping the nuances of probability distributions.
